MAIN: Find_conflict.sh
- MAIN PROGRAM
- USAGE: bash Find_conflict.sh <graphdir> <edgedir> <outprefix>
    - outname is the name of the output file that computes fraction of edges that are in conflict strucuture

find_conf_disc_all_paths.py
- for each discordant edge, determine if it is involved in conflict structure

find_fraction.sh
- Run squid and diploid-squid on all TCGA graphs. (Graphs produced by squid beforehand)
- calls fraction_edge_in_conf.py
 
fraction_edge_in_conf.py
- computes fraction of edges that are in conflict structure for each sample

get_num_disc_conf.sh
- gets total number of discrodant edges
