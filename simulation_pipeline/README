To prepare the files needed for simulation (reference, annotation, etc.), run
    bash prepare_simulation.sh

To simulate break points, run 
    python simulate_breakpoints.py <gtf> <chrom-sizes> <out-dir>

Chrom-sizes can be produced by running
    samtools faidx <fasta> | cut -f 1,2 > chrom_sizes.txt

After the break points have been simnulated, run
    bash wrapper_pipeline.sh <out-dir>
